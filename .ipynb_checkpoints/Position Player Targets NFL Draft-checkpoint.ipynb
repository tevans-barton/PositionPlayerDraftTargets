    "# Position Players for the Green Bay Packers to Target in the 2019 NFL Draft\n",
    "###### By Tommy Evans-Barton, Wannabe Data Scientist and Diehard Packers Fan\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, the Green Bay Packers are in the alien position of having a new head coach, Matt LaFleur, and with him, an entirely new offensive scheme predicated on the \"illusion of complexity\" and the zone running scheme. While we could go on and on analyzing this scheme, a lot of people have frankly already done this (I particularly like __[this](http://www.packtothefuture.com/articles/xs-and-os-lafleurs-pass-game-in-week-2/)__ series of breakdowns by *Pack to the Future's* Ben Clubb), and maybe I will too in the future. However, for now, I wanted to try to do something a little bit different.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's no secret that there have been some issues with the skill positions (Wide Receivers, Tight Ends, and Running Backs) in the past for the Packers. For Wide Receivers, it's a case of injuries and inexperience, with rookies playing heavy snap percentages on offense (Data courtesy of __[Football Outsiders](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/snapcounts)__):\n",
    "\n",
    "| Rookie | Offensive Snap Percentage|\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| M. Valdes-Scantling | 64.4% |\n",
    "| E. St. Brown | 33.3% |\n",
    "| J. Moore | 6.9% |\n",
    "| J. Kumerow | 12.7% |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "due to injuries to Randall Cobb and Geronimo Allison. For the Tight End room, Jimmy Graham and Marcedes Lewis have been hit hard by father time, and Lance Kendricks, in my dad's words, is J.A.G (Just A Guy). Running backs have also felt the sting of injury, with Aaron Jones having the second knee injury of his NFL career in 2018, but unlike in the case of the other two positions, their borderline *criminal* misusage last year makes me hold off judgement, at least for another season.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this is to say that the skill players could use an upgrade, or at the very least some reenforcements. But who will fit this new coach's schemes? Who can answer the call? That's what we hope to find out, so don't touch that dial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of success in this scheme, no two coaches have shown more promise than Los Angeles's Sean McVay and San Francisco's Kyle Shanahan, coincidentally Matt LaFleur's two mentors. It seems reasonable, therefore, that with the relative success of these two schemes (yes I know the 49ers went 4-12, but considering they were starting Nick Mullens, I'll cut Shanahan some slack) LaFleur may try to acquire similar skill players for our team too.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we're going to go in depth on the position players that have recently fit this new age scheme, and how analyzing their attributes, testing, and college statistics may lead us to find similar players and contributors in this year's draft. We'll be looking Ready? Let's do this."

    "## A Note on Coding, and Some Terms to Know\n",
    "\n",
    "I know a lot of people who may be reading this just looked at the cell above and said \"Uh-uh this ain't it chief,\" or \"Well that's the nerdiest thing I've ever seen\" and to be honest you guys are spot on with that second one. I'm doing this analysis in the only way I know how, with Python, but I know a lot of people reading this won't have a very strong background in coding or statistics, and may find a lot of the code hard to follow, or even intimidating. But I want this breakdown to be able to cater to everyone: the stats nerds (like me), the arm-chair GM's (also me), and the casual fans who tune in every other week. That means I'll be doing my best to explain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why I decided to do what I did when it comes to the data\n",
    "2. What each method that I wrote is aiming to do\n",
    "3. How the code aims to do this (where an explanation is easy)\n",
    "4. What the statistical conclusions mean\n",
    "\n",
    "and anything else that may come up along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, however, some terms I may use casually that you might want to know, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cell** - what you're reading this in right now! It can either be filled with text, like this one, or with code, like the one above.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function** - essentially a section of code that will give you a value or values at the end. What this value is (a number vs. a group of numbers vs. a word) depends on the function, and can really be almost anything! \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null/NaN(Not a Number)** - this means exactly what you think it means: Nothing. This happens in a set of data when there's just nothing put in. It can either happen on purpose (i.e. if a receiver didn't play any games, their receiving yards might be `Null/NaN`, with no value entered for them) or on accident (i.e. someone forgot to put a piece of data in). The second of these is unlikely in our dataset, but just keep in mind that it CAN happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DataFrame** - whenever I say this, you can pretty much replace it with the word 'table'. They're basically the same thing, DataFrame is just the coding word for this specific type of table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So try not to get too worried about the code, or the tables, and just get as deep into it as you want. Any feedback is more than welcome, so hit me up with some comments, etc. And for those of you who DO find code interesting, the python file is in the directory. So, without further ado, let's do some cool ass football data shit!"

Also, catch percentage will be updated to be included over a two year span.\n",
