    "# Position Players for the Green Bay Packers to Target in the 2019 NFL Draft\n",
    "###### By Tommy Evans-Barton, Mediocre Data Scientist and Diehard Packers Fan\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, the Green Bay Packers are in the unfamiliar position of having a new head coach, Matt LaFleur, and with him, an entirely new offense predicated on the \"illusion of complexity\" and the zone running scheme. While we could go on and on analyzing this scheme, a lot of people have already done this (I particularly like __[this](http://www.packtothefuture.com/articles/xs-and-os-lafleurs-pass-game-in-week-2/)__ series of breakdowns by *Pack to the Future's* Ben Clubb), and while I might throw my hat in the ring too, for now I wanted to try to do something a little bit different.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's no secret that there have been some issues with the skill positions (Wide Receivers, Tight Ends, and Running Backs) in the past few seasons for the Packers. For Wide Receivers, it's a case of injuries and inexperience, with rookies playing heavy snap percentages on offense (data courtesy of __[Football Outsiders](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/snapcounts)__):\n",
    "\n",
    "| Rookie | Offensive Snap Percentage|\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| M. Valdes-Scantling | 64.4% |\n",
    "| E. St. Brown | 33.3% |\n",
    "| J. Moore | 6.9% |\n",
    "| J. Kumerow | 12.7% |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "due to injuries to Randall Cobb and Geronimo Allison. For the Tight End room, Jimmy Graham and Marcedes Lewis have been hit hard by father time, and Lance Kendricks, in my dad's words, is a J.A.G (Just A Guy). Running backs have also felt the sting of injury (with Aaron Jones having the second knee injury of his NFL career in as many years), but overall youth coupled with the borderline *criminal* misusage of this position group last year causes me to withhold most of my criticisms, at least for another season.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, all of this is to say that the skill players could use an upgrade, or at the very least some reenforcements. But who will fit this new coach's schemes? Who can answer the call? That's what we hope to find out, so don't touch that dial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of success running this scheme, no two coaches have shown more promise than the Los Angeles Rams's Sean McVay and the San Francisco 49ers's Kyle Shanahan, LaFleur's two coaching mentors. Given the relative success of these two schemes (yes I know the 49ers went 4-12, but considering they were starting Nick Mullens, I'll cut Shanahan some slack), it seems reasonable to assume that LaFleur's scheme will run best with players like those that play well in L.A. and S.F., and that these are the types of players he will be telling Gutekuns to add in the draft. So the question is, who are these players?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we're going to go in depth on the position players from the Rams and 49ers that have helped catapult this new-age scheme into popularity, and determine which players have been good 'schematic fits', i.e. find who has succeeded in this scheme. From this, we're going to treat these players as prototypes, and compile their college statistics and combine athletic testing numbers. We will then go through the 2019 draft looking for players most similar to our prototypes, a.k.a. the players that Gutekunst will most likely add/want to add in order to make this system work in Green Bay. So, without futher ado, let's get to it."

    "## A Note on Coding, and Some Terms to Know\n",
    "\n",
    "I know a lot of people who may be reading this just looked at the cell above and said \"Uh-uh this ain't it chief,\" or \"Well that's the second nerdiest thing I've ever seen\" and to be honest the latter is spot on. I'm doing this analysis in the only way I know how, with coding and statistics, but I know a lot of people reading this won't have a very strong background in either, and may find a lot of the code hard to follow or even intimidating. However, I want to do my best to make this breakdown cater to everyone: from the stats nerds (like me), to the arm-chair GM's (also me), all the way to the casual fans who tune in every other week. That means I'll be doing my best to explain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why I decided to do what I did when it comes to the data, and why I decided to use the data I chose\n",
    "2. What the purpose of each function I wrote and step I took was\n",
    "3. How the code aims to accomplish these steps (where an explanation is easy)\n",
    "4. What the statistical conclusions mean\n",
    "\n",
    "and anything else that may come up along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, however, some terms I may use casually that you might want to familiarize yourself with, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cell** - what you're reading this in right now! It can either be filled with text, like this one, or with code, like the one above.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function** - essentially a section of code that will give you a value or values at the end. What this value is (a number vs. a group of numbers vs. a word) depends on the function, and can really be almost anything. If you see something in the form `spf.<>` in one of the code blocks, it's a function I have written that you can find in the SkillPlayerFunctions.py file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null/NaN(Not a Number)** - this means exactly what you think it means: Nothing. This happens in a data set when there's just nothing put in. It can either happen on purpose (i.e. if a receiver didn't play any games, their receiving yards might be `Null/NaN`, as there is no value entered for them) or on accident (i.e. someone forgot to put a piece of data in). The second of these is unlikely in our dataset, but just keep in mind that it CAN happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DataFrame** - whenever I say this, you can pretty much replace it with the word 'table'. They're basically the same thing, a DataFrame is just the coding word for this specific type of table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Map** - when we take one value and replace it with another one. You're original value is often called a 'key' and what it maps to is the 'value'. So something like {'a' : 1 } means that the letter 'a' is 'mapped' to the value 1, i.e. that 'a' will be replaced with 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comments** - When you see a line in a code cell with a hashtag in front of it (`#<...>`) this is just a comment that I've included to tell you something about how the code in that cell is working/what it is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, however, the moral of the story is: try not to get too worried about the code or the tables, because you'll be able to understand everything in here without it. On the other hand, if you ARE the type of person who's a statistics/data science nerd, and DOES want to look at the code, I've attached it all in a .py file in this directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, any feedback is more than welcome; I know this writeup isn't perfect, but I'm trying to improve my writing as much as anyone, and I can't do that without knowing what's wrong with it. So if a step I took is unclear, or you want more clarification on a decision I made, or if you even feel like some of the conclusions or assumptions I made are just wrong, let me know. Questions, comments, concerns, I want all of it, so hit me up.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, with all of that out of the way, let's get down to it and see how this all plays out!"

    "Now, since we have two years worth of stats, we want to find a good way to combine these two seasons. In this analysis, I have decided that it's probably best to go on a per game basis for attempts, receptions, touchdowns, and yards as well as a per reception/per attempt for yards, as I believe this will limit the affect that missing games will have, and with two years (a maximum of 32 games) as our sample size, this should mitigate the risk of having a few small or big games (looking at you Derrick Henry) greatly affect our data. Also, we'll adjust catch percentage to account for the two year span.\n",

    "### Cuts Based on Small Sample Size/Low Usage\n",
    "And now that we have merged our data, we can make a first round of removals based on small sample size and low usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, it is with a heavy heart that we must say fairwell to `C.J. Anderson` (I can here the voice saying \"you've been voted off the island\" as I type). Yes, he had a good run at the end of the season. Yes he almost single handedly made an MVP ride the bench, for some reason (Todd Gurley missing flyers are still up all over the city of L.A.). And ultimately he did play well for the Rams. But 2 games is simply not a big enough sample size to draw any conclusions on whether or not he is a type of player that works in this system, so it's goodbye to everyone's favorite bowling ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for low usage on the Rams, it is also fair to cut `Malcolm Brown`, `Derek Carrier`, `Pharoh Cooper`, `Gerald Everett` and `Mike Thomas` (no not THAT Mike Thomas) as all the receivers averaged less than 2 touches a game, Brown averages less than 5 carries a game, and none of them had more than 3 starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 49ers' players, the cuts are a little less painful. First, we can certainly remove `Logan Paulsen` as he had no receiving or rushing statistics while on the 49ers (don't worry I double checked). We can also remove `Richie James`, `Jeff Wilson`, `Aldrick Robinson`, and `Trent Taylor` as none of them started in more than two games. Additionally, Wilson was only active for 6 games, James averaged less than a touch per game, with Robinson and Taylor barely having many more. These low usage numbers show that, while used in a pinch, these players aren't the type of player preferred by Shanahan, and therefore probably aren't the type of player to use as a prototype for his system. Note: while I'm tempted to remove `Alfred Morris` for similar reasons (only having one start in twelve games), running back starts aren't as important in the modern day NFL, as change of pace backs become more prevalent, and unlike Wilson he was active for 12 games with San Francisco and his 10 rushing attempts per game is a reasonable contribution."

    "There are a few players who had a decent number of games and starts, but ultimately fell out of favor once other players came along.\n",

    "The first of these that I'm going to argue can be removed is `Garrett Celek` for the following reasons:\n",
    "1. He's 30 years old and has been on the team since 2012. He's not a player chosen by Shanahan, so he wasn't chosen for the scheme, he was kept around for depth and for a veteran presence.\n",
    "2. More importantly, after starting in 13 games last season and amassing 33 targets in 2017, this past season he started in just 1 game, and had only EIGHT targets over the ENTIRE season. EIGHT. This marks a player who is clearly not a preferred starter, and one who is being phased out as quickly as possible."

    "Another one bites the dust. Here's where it gets a little tougher though. We've removed the people that we feel weren't getting used in the system. We've removed the people who weren't preferred starters in the system. But now we need to find those that were unproductive, even when used. We want to see if these players' receiving and rushing numbers are successful in this system by comparing their receiving and rushing stats to those of their peers at their position from the past year. (I'm using one year here because this should be a large enough sample to get reasonable values to compare our players against, and the receiving numbers shouldn't vary too much year to year). We're going to start by showing the process with the receiving data, and then do the same with the rushing data, albeit a little faster."

    "- `Brandin Cooks`: while not necessarily elite, he is certainly in the realm of really, really good. His statistics, both for receiving and rushing for a receiver, almost all lie around the 85th percentile, with the exception of catch percentage percentile, receiving touchdowns per game, and rush yards per attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Todd Gurley`: has earned his status as an Elite player in this league (maybe play him in the SuperBowl if you get the chance), as he ranks over the 90th percentile in receptions per game, yards per reception, receiving yards per game, receiving touchdowns per game, and rush yards per game amongst running backs, all while maintaining heavy usage, ranking above the 90th percentile in targets per game and rush attempts per game. He is certainly a player to use as a model for future picks at running back, regardless of scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Tyler Higbee`: his statistics strike us as remarkably average, except in catch rate, where he's remarkably BELOW average. He has no statistics that lie above the 70th percentile for tight ends, and seems to not necessarily be just a mediocre tight end, at least in this offense.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Cooper Kupp`: certainly a good starter in this scheme, especially when only considering his receiving statistics (his rushing statistics are all below average, except for yards per attempt). Regardless, he still makes his mark on the offense, ranking near the 80th percentile in almost every major receiving category.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Josh Reynolds`: a disappointing surprise for me, as I expected his percentiles to be higher due to some pretty solid athleticism and opportunities. However, all but one of his statistics fall severely below the fiftieth percentile, with many lying in the twenties and teens.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Robert Woods`: somewhere between Kupp and Cooks (aka between good and really good), as while he isn't as consistent as Kupp in terms of percentiles across categories, he provides more of a running threat, and is more productive when he does catch the ball."

    "**A Preface**: the Niners provide a slight challenge, as one can attempt to make excuses for a lot of poor performances by pointing to the rotation at quarterback. However, while we should keep this in mind, it's important to still be critical of unimpressive statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Alfred Morris`: he needed more analysis earlier, but now it's safe to say that he's just not very good, at least in this scheme. With a catch percentage lying in the abysmally low 8th percentile, there are almost no statistical positives to his game since coming to San Francisco, aside from yards per reception. He's still left searching for that magic he had in Washington all those years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Matt Breida`: an UDFA, Breida has average to slightly below average stats, except in two categories, but those categories stand out to me, as they are yards per reception and yards per rushing attempt. These two statistics both hint to me that Breida has enough talent to make noise with more usage (he was below average in both targets and rushing attempts)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Dante Pettis`: A rookie out of Washington, Pettis intrigues me because, while his percentiles are all over the map, the two extraordinarily high percentiles he had were in yards per reception and receiving touchdowns per game, in the 95th and 80th percentiles, respectively. These two values are indicative of some serious big play ability, and if he can manage to get the other parts of his game up from the average state they are currently in, he has a lot of room for growth, especially as a rookie.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Marquise Goodwin`: While several of his stats are average, we do have to remember that there was severely inconsistent quarterback play, and he still had average to above average numbers in a lot of categories, with big play ability indicated by his incredibly high yards per reception numbers. He really needs to pick up his catch numbers though (15th percentile in catch percentage. Not EVERYTHING is on the quarterback when you've got the lowest catch rate on your team).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Pierre Garcón`: With very high usage numbers (84th percentile) comes the expectation of higher production. But this just didn't materialize for Garcón, as his catch percentage rate is the second lowest on the team, but without nearly any of the promising markers that Goodwin had.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Kendrick Bourne`: Just a Guy, slightly below average, nothing much special.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `George Kittle`: Super. Star. Two words, all you need to know. High 90th percentile in every category, including in targets per game. Consistently dominant"

    "For those of you who skipped ahead, good decision, but let me at least explain how we got here so you're not left spinning around wondering where you are and what year it is. To be brief, we pretty much went through Rams and 49ers skill players, getting rid of those who didn't get much playing time, and then compared some of their statistics to those of others at their position in the league. We took those who compared favorably to their peers in a majority of categories or in categories that we felt indicated room for improvement (especially in a San Francisco offense stunted by poor Quarterback play).\n",
