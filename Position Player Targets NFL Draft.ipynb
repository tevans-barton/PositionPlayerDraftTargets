    "# Position Players for the Green Bay Packers to Target in the 2019 NFL Draft\n",
    "###### By Tommy Evans-Barton, Mediocre Data Scientist and Diehard Packers Fan\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, the Green Bay Packers are in the unfamiliar position of having a new head coach, Matt LaFleur, and with him, an entirely new offense predicated on the \"illusion of complexity\" and the zone running scheme. While we could go on and on analyzing this scheme, a lot of people have already done this (I particularly like __[this](http://www.packtothefuture.com/articles/xs-and-os-lafleurs-pass-game-in-week-2/)__ series of breakdowns by *Pack to the Future's* Ben Clubb), and maybe I will too in the future. However, for now, I wanted to try to do something a little bit different.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's no secret that there have been some issues with the skill positions (Wide Receivers, Tight Ends, and Running Backs) in the past few seasons for the Packers. For Wide Receivers, it's a case of injuries and inexperience, with rookies playing heavy snap percentages on offense (Data courtesy of __[Football Outsiders](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/snapcounts)__):\n",
    "\n",
    "| Rookie | Offensive Snap Percentage|\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| M. Valdes-Scantling | 64.4% |\n",
    "| E. St. Brown | 33.3% |\n",
    "| J. Moore | 6.9% |\n",
    "| J. Kumerow | 12.7% |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "due to injuries to Randall Cobb and Geronimo Allison. For the Tight End room, Jimmy Graham and Marcedes Lewis have been hit hard by father time, and Lance Kendricks, in my dad's words, is a J.A.G (Just A Guy). Running backs have also felt the sting of injury, with Aaron Jones having the second knee injury of his NFL career in 2018, but unlike in the case of the other two positions, their borderline *criminal* misusage last year causes me to withhold judgement, at least for another season.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this is to say that the skill players could use an upgrade, or at the very least some reenforcements. But who will fit this new coach's schemes? Who can answer the call? That's what we hope to find out, so don't touch that dial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of success running this scheme, no two coaches have shown more promise than Los Angeles's Sean McVay and San Francisco's Kyle Shanahan, coincidentally Matt LaFleur's two mentors. With the relative success of these two schemes (yes I know the 49ers went 4-12, but considering they were starting Nick Mullens, I'll cut Shanahan some slack) it seems reasonable to assume that LaFleur may try to acquire like-players to those currently in LA and SF. And while Free Agency is, in my mind, a band-aid for flaws, true, lasting improvement only comes through the draft.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we're going to go in depth on the position players that have helped catapult this new-age scheme into popularity, and use an analysis of their attributes, testing, and college statistics to hopefully help us find similar players and future contributors in this year's draft. Ready? Let's do this."

    "## A Note on Coding, and Some Terms to Know\n",
    "\n",
    "I know a lot of people who may be reading this just looked at the cell above and said \"Uh-uh this ain't it chief,\" or \"Well that's the second nerdiest thing I've ever seen\" and to be honest that second one is spot on. I'm doing this analysis in the only way I know how, with Python, but I know a lot of people reading this won't have a very strong background in coding or statistics, and may find a lot of the code hard to follow, or even intimidating. But I want this breakdown to be able to cater to everyone: the stats nerds (like me), the arm-chair GM's (also me), and the casual fans who tune in every other week. That means I'll be doing my best to explain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why I decided to do what I did when it comes to the data\n",
    "2. What each method that I wrote is aiming to do\n",
    "3. How the code aims to do this (where an explanation is easy)\n",
    "4. What the statistical conclusions mean\n",
    "\n",
    "and anything else that may come up along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, however, some terms I may use casually that you might want to know, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cell** - what you're reading this in right now! It can either be filled with text, like this one, or with code, like the one above.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function** - essentially a section of code that will give you a value or values at the end. What this value is (a number vs. a group of numbers vs. a word) depends on the function, and can really be almost anything\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null/NaN(Not a Number)** - this means exactly what you think it means: Nothing. This happens in a data set when there's just nothing put in. It can either happen on purpose (i.e. if a receiver didn't play any games, their receiving yards might be `Null/NaN`, with no value entered for them) or on accident (i.e. someone forgot to put a piece of data in). The second of these is unlikely in our dataset, but just keep in mind that it CAN happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DataFrame** - whenever I say this, you can pretty much replace it with the word 'table'. They're basically the same thing, a DataFrame is just the coding word for this specific type of table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Map** - when we take one value and replace it with another one\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Moral of the story, try not to get too worried about the code or the tables (unless you want to), and just get as into it as you want. Any feedback is more than welcome, so hit me up with those comments, questions, and concerns. And for those of you who DO find code interesting, the .py file is in the directory. So, without further ado, let's do some cool ass football data shit!"

    "Now, since we have two years worth of stats, we want to find a good way to combine these two seasons. In this analysis, I have decided that it's probably best to go on a per game basis for attempts, receptions, touchdowns, and yards as well as a per reception/per attempt for yards, as I believe this will limit the affect that missing games will have, and with two years (a maximum of 32 games) as our sample size, this should mitigate the risk of having large or small outliers (looking at you Derrick Henry) greatly affect our data. Also, catch percentage will be adjusted to account for the two year span.\n",

    "Unfortunately, it is with a heavy heart that we must say fairwell to `C.J. Anderson`; please pack your knives and go. Yes, he had a good run at the end of the season. Yes he almost single handedly made an MVP ride the bench, for some reason (Todd Gurley missing flyers are still up all over the city of L.A.). And ultimately he did play well for the Rams. But 2 games is simply not a big enough sample size to draw any conclusions on whether or not he is a type of player that works in this system, and so it's goodbye for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 49ers' players, the cuts are a little less painful. We can initially remove both `Richie James` and `Jeff Wilson`, as neither started in many games, (2 starts respectively). Additionally, Wilson was only active for 6 games, and James averaged less than a touch per game. These low usage numbers show that, while used in a pinch, these players aren't the type of player preferred by Shanahan, and therefore probably aren't the type of player to use as a prototype for his system. Note: while I'm tempted to remove `Alfred Morris` for similar reasons, running back starts aren't as important in the modern day NFL, as change of pace backs become more prevalent, and unlike Wilson he was active for 12 games with San Francisco. 10 rushing attempts per game isn't nothing."

    "The next player that I'm going to argue can be removed is `Garrett Celek` for the following reasons:\n",
    "1. He's 30 years old and has been on the team since 2012. He's not a player chosen by Shanahan, so he wasn't chosen for the scheme, he was kept around for depth and for a veteran presence.\n",
    "2. More importantly, after starting in 13 games last season and amassing 33 targets in 2017, this past season he started in just 1 game, and had only EIGHT targets over the ENTIRE season. EIGHT. This marks a player who is clearly not a preferred starter, and one who is being phased out as quickly as possible."

But now we need to find those that were unproductive, even when used. Our first step is to see if these players' receiving numbers are successful in this system by comparing their receiving stats to those of their peers at their position from the past year. (I'm using one year here because this should be a large enough sample to get a reasonable value to compare our players against, and the receiving numbers shouldn't vary too much year to year)."

    "- `Todd Gurley`: has earned his status as an Elite player in this league (maybe play him in the SuperBowl if you get the chance), as he ranks over the 90th percentile in receptions per game, yards per reception, receiving yards per game, receiving touchdowns per game, and rush yards per game amongst running backs, all while maintaining heavy usage, ranking above the 90th percentile in targets per game and rush attempts per game. He is certainly a player to use as a model for future picks at running back, regardless of scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Brandin Cooks`: while not necessarily elite, he is certainly in the realm of really, really good. His statistics, both for receiving and rushing for a receiver, almost all lie around the 85th percentile, with the exception of catch percentage percentile, receiving touchdowns per game, and rush yards per attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Tyler Higbee`: his statistics strike us as remarkably average, except in catch rate, where he's remarkably BELOW average. He has no statistics that lie above the 70th percentile for tight ends, and seems to not necessarily be just a mediocre tight end, at least in this offense.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Cooper Kupp`: certainly a good starter in this scheme, especially when only considering his receiving statistics (his rushing statistics are all below average, except for yards per attempt). Regardless, he still makes his mark on the offense, ranking near the 80th percentile in almost every major receiving category.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Josh Reynolds`: a disappointing surprise for me, as I expected his percentiles to be higher due to some pretty solid athleticism and opportunities. However, all but one of his statistics fall severely below the fiftieth percentile, with many lying in the twenties and teens.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Robert Woods`: somewhere between Kupp and Cooks (aka between good and really good), as while he isn't as consistent as Kupp in terms of percentiles across categories, he provides more of a running threat, and is more productive when he does catch the ball."

    "**A Preface**: the Niners provide a slight challenge, as one can attempt to make excuses for a lot of poor performances by pointing to the rotation at quarterback. However, while we should keep this in mind, it's important to still be critical of unimpressive statistics.\n",

    "- `Alfred Morris`: he needed more analysis earlier, but now it's safe to say that he's just not very good, at least in this scheme. With a catch percentage lying in the abysmally low 8th percentile, there are almost no statistical positives to his game since coming to San Francisco, aside from yards per reception. He's still left searching for that magic he had in Washington all those years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Matt Breida`: an UDFA, Breida has average to slightly below average stats, except in two categories, but those categories stand out to me, as they are yards per reception and yards per rushing attempt. These two statistics both hint to me that Breida has enough talent to make noise with more usage (he was below average in both targets and rushing attempts)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Dante Pettis`: A rookie out of Washington, Pettis intrigues me because, while his percentiles are all over the map, the two extraordinarily high percentiles he had were in yards per reception and receiving touchdowns per game, in the 95th and 80th percentiles, respectively. These two values are indicative of some serious big play ability, and if he can manage to get the other parts of his game up from the average state they are currently in, he has a lot of room for growth, especially as a rookie.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Marquise Goodwin`: While several of his stats are average, we do have to remember that there was severely inconsistent quarterback play, and he still had average to above average numbers in a lot of categories, with big play ability indicated by his incredibly high yards per reception numbers. He really needs to pick up his catch numbers though (15th percentile in catch percentage. Not EVERYTHING is on the quarterback when you've got the lowest catch rate on your team).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Pierre Garcón`: With very high usage numbers (84th percentile) comes the expectation of higher production. But this just didn't materialize for Garcón, as his catch percentage rate is the second lowest on the team, but without nearly any of the promising markers that Goodwin had.\n",
    "\n",

    "- `Kendrick Bourne`: Just a Guy, slightly below average, nothing much special.\n",

To be brief, we pretty much went through Rams and 49ers skill players, getting rid of those who didn't get much playing time, and then compared some of their statistics to those of others at their position in the league. We took those who compared favorably to their peers in a majority of categories or in categories that we felt indicated room for improvement (especially in a San Francisco offense stunted by poor Quarterback play).\n",
